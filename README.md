This README will server as my documentation on the process of building this project

The goal is to create a youtube-like or netflix-ish kinda video platform
-> has users
-> users can upload, edit, delete their own videos
-> will decide on what features will be added on videos (like like/dislike or share link)

To install this repository clone using
```
git clone git@github.com:pewepskei/videoStream.git
```

Day 0: Create a working framework with a working CRUD method

Day 1: Created Comments and Profiles database, barely functional but looks good to me
